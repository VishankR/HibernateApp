->  If you give an whole entity reference in select clause then superclass polymorphism happens and may select queries gets generated on the basis of
    superclass. For eg. for query "QUERY_GET_ORDER_BY_STATUS" if we use SELECT o instead of o.shipName then select queries will be generated on the
    basis of superclass of OrdersEntity for eg. here Employees, Customers. But if superclass is not an Entity (which happens when superclass is annotated
    with @MappedSuperClass) then dynamic polymorphism wont happen for that superclass. For every separate superclass and subclass (All subclasses that
    have 1->n mapping with this current class and All superclasses that have n->1 mapping with this current class) a separate select query will be generated.
